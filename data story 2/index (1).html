			The New-Fashion Pay Gap
		</h1>
		<h3> 	The "gig" economy offers workers more flexibility, autonomy, and the absence of tradition discrimination— so why are women still making less money than men? </h3>
		
	</div>

	<div>
		<p> In the modern day job market, the “side hustle” has never looked more appealing. You can control how often, when, and for how long you work thanks for apps like Uber, Lyft and TaskRabbit. One might think that with that kind of control, this new kind of industry would create an equal playing field for men and women, leaving behind the wage gap and another remnants of old-school discrimination that plague tradition businesses.</p>
		<p>This is not the case. Male Uber drivers earn roughly 7% more than their female counterparts. Uber does not set different rates based on the gender of their drivers, but nuances of race and gender are implicitly interwoven in reasons behind the differences in these numbers. Though racism is troubling present both inside the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/07/11/uber-hr-boss-out-wake-charges-she-ignored-employee-complaints-racist-behavior/774878002/)" target="blank"> company </a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/race-good-and-bad-ride-share/" target="blank"> with it's costumers</a>, but for the purpose of this article we will be focusing on gender.</p>

		<p>The price of an Uber ride varies based on its time and location, and put quite frankly, men are more likely to take more dangerous, but lucrative rides. Men are more likely to accept a ride from rowdy passengers leaving drinking establishments, like bars or club, late into the evening when prices are surging. When Stanford researchers studied the gender differences of Uber wages in Chicago, they found that male drivers were more likely to live near these locations, and therefore had a shorter time as they drove uncompensated to pick up their passenger and begin the official ride. Men were also more likely to accept the pricey and relatively long distance rides. </p>

		<p>Another reason has to do with the length of time the driver stays on the app. On average, a driver who has completed more than 2,500 rides earns 14% more than a new driver with less than 100 rides. This can be attributed the best routes and more profitable hours and locations, as well the ability to strategically cancel and accept different rides. Men typically stay on the app longer than women. Though it should be note there are a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/01/uber-sexual-assault-allegations-female-drivers-san-diego" target="blank">large</a> <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/138416-i-was-sexually-assaulted-by-my-uber-passenger" target="blank">number</a> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5916045/Convicted-child-rapist-21-arrested-sexually-assaulting-female-Uber-driver.htm"> of reasons</a> why women drivers leave the app or do not drive during surging, nightime hours.</p>
		<p>The last factor may sound a little counterintuitive at first– drivers working more than 30 hours a week actually earning <i>less</i> than those who worker fewer than 10 hours a week. This is thought to be be because experienced drivers who know lucrative routes can cherry pick the best hours and make the most out their time as a driver, which is all to say, flexibility of hours does not necessarily mean more money earned. Experience and willingness to take on rides of dubious location and time, account for more than people think. <p>
		<p>What do female rideshare drivers do when they have to choose between their own safety and making a living wage? Dismantling the driving societal factors behind assault, the unspoken danger facing a woman who makes a living with her back turned to strangers, is a harder sell than breaking your tradition glass ceiling of gender pay differential. What is clear is that the way women are disadvantaged in the workforce stems from the same root causes that disadvantage women in all different facets of their lives.</p>
