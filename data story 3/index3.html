	<h1> How Technology is Affecting Your Relationship </h1>
	<h3> Whether the effect is positive or negative depends on how you're using your devices.</h3>
	<H4>By: Katie Bourque</H4>

		<p> Modern technology has undoubtedly changed the way we date. There are dating apps like Tinder and Bumble that have revolutionized the way people meet, as well as social media like Instagram and Twitter that make getting in touch with acquaintances far easier. The way we live online makes it easier to begin new relationships, but how does the digital world effect those already in relationships? This is where the story changes.</p>

		<div class="paragraph2">
			<p> The date from this student was broken up into between couples from 18 to 29 and couples from 30 to 49, all of whom regular reported to using the internet. Within this younger demographic, a little more than half of those who said the internet had an affect on their relationship said that the impact was minor. However, the other half of these respondants said that the effect was major. </p> 

				<p>The results also varied by how long the couples had been in relationships. Only 16% of those who had been together more than 10 years reported that the internet had an impact, and only 5% reported that it was a major effect. However, the number was much higher for those together less than 10 years. 36% of couples together less than 10 years said the internet had an impact on their relationship, and almost half, 15%, reported that it was serious. Individuals in partnerships for less than 10 years, as well as those in relationship under the age of the 30, were much more likely to use the internet the same way a single person would. This includes using social media to communicate and check up on people they have dated in the past.  </p>

		<div class="section2">
		<p> Young adults reported more internet use, they also were more likely to report experiencing the negative effects of technology in relationships. Regardless of age group, the most common greviance amongst those in a relationship was the feeling that their significant other was paying more attention to their phone then they were to them. </p> 
		<p>A quarter of all cell phone owners in a committed relationship have felt that their spouse or partner was distracted by their cell phone when spending time together. However, this rate drastically increases among young people, with almost half of the couples surveyed reporting feeling their partner's cellphone use caused a problem in the relationship. Young people in relationships were also more likely to report problems arising from how much time their parnet spent online, as well as problems from what their partner did online.

			However, just as the younger generation of couples were more likey to feel the negative effects of technology, they also reported more positive effects than their older counterparts. People under 30 were almost twice as likely as those older than 30 to report feeling closer to their partner because of conversations that happened over text. They were also more likely to solve a problem they were having difficulty solving face to face over text. Those who have been in relatiionships for less than 10 years were also more likely to report experiencing these deeper sense of connection through technology than those who have been together for more than 10 years.

			Internet usage can certainly drive a wedge between you and your partner, but that does not necessarily mean you have to break up with your phone. When using internet to comunnicate, instea of avoid, your partner, it can add a layer of intimacy to your relationship instead of dinstance. 
			At the end of the day, your relationship with your phone can strength, or weaken, your relationship with your partner.
